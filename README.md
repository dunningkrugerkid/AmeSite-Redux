i like staring at stars, so now i stare at star data

the original vision - a web app that fetches astronomical data - is done. 
i am expanding on the project by doing some front end work and hiding gnarly json for the sake of your eye holes

my instance of the backend runs at amesite.fly.dev most of the time, and you can host it yourself if you wanna. i used fly, you don't have to.

spits out a nicely formatted json of info regarding a random star from the simbad astronomical database.
